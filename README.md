[INSERT PHOTO HERE]

The Arduino IDE version 1.8.19 for MacOS was used to write the code for this project. An ESP32 TTGO T-Display was connected to the host computer via a USB cable which was selected as the port under Tools in the IDE. 

Troubleshooting:
ESP32 TTGO T-Display won't turn on:
- Make sure a blue light is being emitted from device, if not, this indicates that there is currently no power connected to the device. Try flipping the orientation of your power source (USB cable or wire connected to plugin for a battery)
